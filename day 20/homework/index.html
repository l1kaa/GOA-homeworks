    <h3>about this book:</h3>
    <p class="desc">Nineteen Eighty-four, novel by English author George Orwell published in 1949 as a warning against totalitarianism. <br>The novelâ€™s chilling dystopia made a deep impression on readers, and Orwellâ€™s ideas entered mainstream culture <br>in a way achieved by very few books. The bookâ€™s title and many of its concepts, such as Big Brother and the Thought Police,<br> are instantly recognized and understood, often as bywords for modern social and political abuses.</p>
