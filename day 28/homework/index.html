    <h1>5 types of programming languages</h1>
    <br>
    <p>1. Procedural programming languages
        A procedural language follows a sequence of statements or commands in order to achieve a desired output. Each series of steps is called a procedure, and a program written in one of these languages will have one or more procedures within it. Common examples of procedural languages include: C and C++, Java, Pascal, BASIC
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Functional programming languages
        Rather than focusing on the execution of statements, functional languages focus on the output of mathematical functions and evaluations. Each function–a reusable module of code–performs a specific task and returns a result. The result will vary depending on what data you input into the function. Some popular functional programming languages include: Scala,Erlang,Haskell,Elixir,F#</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>3. Object-oriented programming languages (OOP)
        This type of language treats a program as a group of objects composed of data and program elements, known as attributes and methods. Objects can be reused within a program or in other programs. This makes it a popular language type for complex programs, as code is easier to reuse and scale. Some common object-oriented languages include:Java,Python,PHP,C++,Ruby.
    </p>

    <p>4. Scripting languages
        Programmers use scripting languages to automate repetitive tasks, manage dynamic web content, or support processes in larger applications. Some common scripting languages include:PHP, Ruby,python,bash, Perl, Node.js.

        </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>5. Logic programming languages
        Instead of telling a computer what to do, a logic programming language expresses a series of facts and rules to instruct the computer on how to make decisions. Some examples of logic languages include: Prolog,Absys,Datalog,Alma-0.
