<p> i really enjoy programming because i have so much interest in it. while other people might
    complain when they get homeworks in GOA academy, i'm completely the opposite and everytime
    i start it,  enjoy every moment of it tobe honest. other than the homeworks, i always try to
    practice more, make a project and gather ideas about the projects i might do sooner or later

<h2>❤️‍🔥 Playing a guitar 🎸</h2>

<p> i started playing a guitar about a year ago and i should say that i learned how to play it
    pretty quickly and easily. i think that might be because i seem to have a talent in music in general.
    also, i started to play a classical guitar with intentions of switching to an electric guitar and 
    honestly, i can't wait to start playing an electric guitar. i'll add one more thing and say that
    playing a guitar is an activity that truly brings me comfort and it's one of my favorite hobbies🖤

<h2>🤍 Reading books 📖</h2>

<p>honestly, alongside my hobbies, i don't think there's a better thing to do than read a book 
    when u have free time. my favorite book genres are mostly: psycological,thriller and detective.
    also, out of classic novelists, my one of favorites to read is - albert camus. i love his ideology
    the way he expresses things in his books, especially in "the stranger" ("l'etranger"). out of
    psycological i really enjoy reading "48 laws of power".

<h2>🤍 Listening to music 🎧</h2>

<p> listening to music is one of my favorite things to do. in fact i love it so much that
    i listen to music while taking a walk, doing homework,writing codes, while sleeping and etc.
    my fav genres are: rock - (mostly alternative rock), metal and indie pop. as for my fav artists:
    i mostly listen to - <b> The Neighboarhood, the artcic monkeys, radiohead, deftones, nirvana, 
    lana del rey, cas, TV girl, The weeknd and Childish Gambino.</b> i gotta admit i think i have 
    a pretty good music taste:) and here's a piece of advice: if u ever wanna listen to some cool music,
    check out these artists' music, believe me u won't regret it;)

<p> my fav genres in movies & TV-shows are thriller, phycological-thriller and horror. i've seen so many
    movies that i lost count of it. i mostly enjoy watching movies with my friends. sometimes we gather
    some snacks and watch it at home together and sometimes we go to the movies. if u ever need some
    good film recommendations hit me up;)
