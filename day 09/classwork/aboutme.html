<h2> what you need to know about me</h2>
<p> although there's a lot of things i could say about me, i'll just cut it short and say that 
    i'm 15 y/o and i'm in 10th grade. i have a lot of hobbies such as: playing a guitar, reading books,
    watching movies and TV-shows, 
    listening to music and of course programming (although my goal is to turn it into a career). 
    i became a part of GOA's family about more than a month ago and i've already made an achievment:
    i became a mini-leader of my groupðŸ’ª and i'm intending to make much more achievements 
    in the future with GOA, since this is a GOAL-ORIENTED academy and i have a lot of goals in life:)ðŸ–¤ </p>
