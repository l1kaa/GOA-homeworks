    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>  <span>Prep the toppings:</span>: Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way.</li>
        <li><span>Flatten the dough ball, and stretch out into a round:</span>Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface.

            Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further.
            
            Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter—10 to 12 inches.</li>
        <li><span>Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings:</span>: Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired toppings on the pizza. Be careful not to overload the pizza with too many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy.</li>
        <li><span>Slide pizza into the oven:</span>: Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven (watch your hands, the oven is hot!). Gently shake the peel to see if the dough will easily slide, if not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a bit more cornmeal.

            Slide the pizza off of the peel and onto the baking stone in the oven.</li>
        <li><span> Bake:</span>Bake pizza in the 475°F oven, one at a time, until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10 to 15 minutes. If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.</li>
        <li><span>Enjoy</span>: Serve hot</li>
